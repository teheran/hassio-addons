Adding documentation#
Good documentation helps the consumer of your add-on to understand its usage, explains configuration options, points users in the right direction in the case they have questions or issues, and contains the license under which the add-on was published.

This file containing the documentation is usually referred to as the "DOCS", which is generally published as the DOCS.md file.

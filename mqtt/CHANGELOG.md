Keeping a changelog#
It is likely you are going to release newer versions of your add-on in the future. In case that happens, the users of your add-on would see an upgrade notice and probably want to know what changes were made in the latest version.

A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of your add-on and is generally published as the CHANGELOG.md file.

If you are in need of a guide on keeping a changelog, we would recommend checking the keep a changelog website. They have developed a standard that is used by many open source projects around the world.
